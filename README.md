- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks

## API Integration

The application expects a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

### Expenses
- `GET /api/expenses` - Fetch expenses with optional filters
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create new expense
- `PUT /api/expenses/{id}` - Update existing expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/{id}` - Delete expense

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats/top-days` - Get top spending days
- `GET /api/stats/monthly-change` - Get monthly change percentages
- `GET /api/stats/predict-next-month` - Get next month predictions

### General Data
- `GET /api/user` - Fetch users list
- `GET /api/category` - Fetch categories list

## Key Features Explained

### Responsive Design
The app uses a mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts. Statistics cards automatically adjust from 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop.

### State Management
Redux Toolkit manages three main slices:
- **Expense Slice**: Handles CRUD operations for expenses
- **Stats Slice**: Manages analytics and statistics data
- **General Slice**: Handles users and categories data

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with:
- Network error detection
- User-friendly error messages
- Toast notifications for all states
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo
- Efficient state updates with Redux Toolkit
- Minimal bundle size with Vite
